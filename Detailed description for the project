This GitHub repository houses the code and documentation for a sentiment analysis project focused on tweets related to 6 football clubs, 
comprising 3 from the Premier League (Chelsea, Manchester City, Newcastle United) and 3 from the Championship (Nottingham Forest, Derby, Fulham). 
The sentiment analysis was conducted across 3 distinct phases during the football season: August and September (Phase 1), November and December (Phase 2), 
and April and May (Phase 3).

Data:
The project utilized secondary data provided in the form of 90 CSV files, with each file representing tweets associated with one of the 6 football clubs during the
specified phases. The data collection concentrated solely on league matches due to individual project constraints and time limitations.

Data Cleaning and Processing:
Prior to analysis, the CSV files underwent preprocessing. Blank columns were removed, and the language column was filtered to include only English tweets. 
Subsequently, each file was loaded into R Studio for further processing. Stopwords, punctuations, common words, emojis, symbols, and extra whitespaces were removed 
to refine the textual data.

Analysis Phases:

Phase 1 (August and September): Tweets collected before the matchday of the first five league matches for each team.
Phase 2 (November and December): Analysis conducted on tweets related to five league matches during this period.
Phase 3 (April and May): Focus on tweets during the business end of the season, covering league matches in April and May.

Analysis Steps:

Creation of a corpus from cleaned data.
Establishment of a word frequency threshold to generate a barplot showcasing the most popular words and their frequencies.
Generation of a word cloud to visually represent the top words used by individuals during each phase.
Sentiment analysis performed on each file.
Presentation of sentiment analysis results via barplots, illustrating the percentage distribution of different sentiments within the tweets for each phase.
Note:
This project was carried out individually, and the scope was limited to league matches for practicality and time considerations. 
The repository provides detailed documentation and code for each phase, enabling reproducibility and further exploration of sentiment trends in football-related tweets.
